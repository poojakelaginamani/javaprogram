6. Method Parameters 
Method Parameters is used to in which delecartion after the method name , inside the paramters.
Method Parameter is used you can add the value when you want and separated by comma.
method paramters is used to information passed in method as paramters.
 eg: 
       static void institute(String class){
                System.out.println(name + "Xworkz");
 public static void main(String[] args){
      institute("Vtu","SKSVMACET");
      }
}
   


7 .
 To achieve compile time polymorphism for method overloading  
    it changing the order of parameters
    it changing the datatypes of parameters.
    it changing the number of parameters
Eg:
     public class MethodOverloading{
       multiply(10,12,13);
       multiply((byte)20,(float)11);
       multiply((double)40.8d,34);
public static void main (String[] args){
      static void multiply(int num1,int num2,int num3);
       num4=num1+num2+num3;
return num4;
static void multiply(byte num1,float num2){
       num4=num1+num2;
return num4;
}


8. Var- args is used to before varargs either we use overloaded method or take an array as the method parameter but it was not considered good because it leads to the maintenance problem.
Advantages of we don't have to provide overloaded methods so less code.
Rules
There can be only one variable argument in the method.
Variable argument (varargs) must be the last argument.  
Synatx : returntypes methodname(datatype.variablename(){
}


9. Package : In java Package keyword is used to specifies the java packages in which visible the current java source file reside.
Imports : The import in Java is a keyword that allows the programmer to access packages available in Java. It is used to import a package, sub-package, a class, an interface or enum in the Java program.

 Explicit import : Classes are available inside the package Explicit means direct or when we give the proper path of the java class it will call as explicit import.

e.g:import java.util.Chicken;

Implicit import : Implicit means indirect When we load all the classes of the package in our java code by using (*) it will call as implicit import.

e.g:import java.util.*;

10.Constructor chaining : Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object. 
     public class Chicken{
          double price;
       Chicken (double price){
       this.price=price;
void printInfo(){
System.out.println(this.price);
 }        
}
public class FarmChicken extends Chicken{
    int noOfDays;
    String careTaker;
FarmChicken(int noOfDays , String careTaker){
this.noOfDays=noOfDays;
this.careTaker=careTaker;
}
@override
 void printInfo(){
super.printInfo();
System.out.println(this.noOfDays);
 System.out.println(this.caretaker);
    }
}
public class ChickenRunner{
 public static viod main(String[] args){
Chicken chicken = new Chicken(200);
chicken.printInfo();

FarmChicken farm = new FarmChicken(30,"John");
fram.printInfo();
}

11.  Fibonacci
   class Fibonacci{
public static void main (String[] args) 
{
int n1=int n1=0,n2=1,n3,i,count=10;    
 System.out.print(n1+" "+n2);  
    
 for(i=2;i<count;++i)//loop starts from 2 because 0 and 1 are already printed    
 {    
  n3=n1+n2;    
  System.out.print(" "+n3);    
  n1=n2;    
  n2=n3;    
 }    
  
}}


13.

public class ArrayChecker {

    public static boolean areArraysEqual(int[] value1, int[] value2) {
        
        Arrays.sort(value1);
        Arrays.sort(value2);

        
        return Arrays.equals(value1, value2);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        int[] value1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] value2 = {3, 1, 5, 4, 2}; // contains the same elements as arr1, but in a different order

        boolean result = areArraysEqual(value1, value2);
        System.out.println("Arrays contain the same elements: " + result); // Output: Arrays contain the same elements: true
    }
}

14. Enumeration : 
          It is used to in which contains the group of constants.
           Enum it is keyword.
         eg:
              public enum Days{
               MONDAY, 
               TUESDAY, 
                SUNDAY;
                }
Enumeration why we used becz of to restricted the coming data.

                     compile
15. java.RunnerClass---------------- class.RunnerClass
    
 The JVM stores the code in memory, allocates memory for the static variables, and executes any static initialize block. Memory is not allocated for the object member variables at this point, memory will be allocated for them when an instance of the class, an object, is created.

16. Members of class 
     static varibles
     static methods
     static block
     Constructor
     Methods
     
static variables :
          varibles is uesd to access with class name and it get memory only once in a class at time of class loading.
static method: 
        Method is used to method of static data members and can change the value of it.
static block:
        Static block is intilize the static data members and it is executed before the main method of class loading.
   
Instance Variables: These are variables that represent the state of an object. They are declared within the class and are unique to each instance (object) of the class.

Methods: Methods are functions defined within the class that perform various operations on the object's state or behavior.

Constructors: It is a block of code which is it exectued whenerver object is created and they are used to initialize the object's state.
